# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        MAX = float("inf")
        dp = [0] + [MAX] * amount
        for i in range(1, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min([dp[i - c] if i - c >= 0 else MAX for c in coins]) + 1

        return [dp[amount], -1][dp[amount] == MAX]
