# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(0, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
